# gotoscapejs 
Small go package for building Cytoscape networks that can be visualized with
[Cytoscape.js](http://http://js.cytoscape.org/). 

# Examples 
Have a look at [examples/stdout/main.go](examples/stdout/main.go) for an example
on how to build a simple Cytoscape network and write its json representation to
stdout, and [examples/web](examples/web) for the same network visualized with
Cytoscape.js. If pipelines in [walrus](http://github.com/fjukstad/walrus) is
your thing then have a look at [examples/pipeline](examples/pipeline).
