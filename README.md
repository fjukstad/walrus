# name
Named after the horrible creatures that harrased Nansen and Johansen on the Fram
expedition. 

> There is something remarkably fantastic and prehistoric about these monsters. I could not help thinking of a merman, or something of the kind, as it lay there just under the surface of the water, blowing and snorting for quite a long while at a time, and glaring at us with its round glassy eyes. 
> - Fridtjof Nansen
